# Assignment1
First assignment for the Web and Script course
## External code
text-shadow as well as background:, background-size: and background-attachment were all CSS properties inspired from w3schools. No code was taken directly from the site but the technique was rather learnt and inherited for my portfolio.
## Dimensions Used for Wiewport
Since laptop and Desktop are generally the same, I decided to make one CSS for both called style-desktop. For this viewport I used the dimensions higher than the width of 1024px. The reason being is that anything lower would be considered a tablet or mobile size. Next, the viewport I used for tablet is anything between 600px to 1024px (anything lower than 1024px). This is because under 600 is considered a mobile. Lastly, for mobile I used anything else lower than 600px as it is the general mobile viewport. 

More specifically to the properties of my website, I kept the wrapper of my portfolio at 90% of the page width & the navigation bar stayed at 100% as they are the more major elements of my code. The "project gallary 1" boxes and "project gallary 2" boxes were kept at 30% and an odd number of 96.5% respectively. I kept the resume box on the home page at 100% width since its a pretty important part of that page. A small viewport dimension change I used was to the comments bar on the contacts page as I had changed to a width of 100% of the container. For the mobile/tablet css files, most adjustments stayed the same with only some minor changes. One change was the project gallery as I had adjusted the project boxes by 5-10% in order to make it more bigger on smaller devices. For that same reason I adjusted img & videos to be 90% of their container as it allows them to be viewed more clearly.
## Use of Linear-Gradient
I decided to use Linear Gradient (angle) in both wrapper and body of my Portfolio. This allowed me to have a gradient for all of my html pages (Home, Projects, Contact me, About me) as it created a creative background. I found that using an angled linear-gradient at 135deg looked much better than a regular linear gradient.
## Use of Color Scheme
The color scheme I used was found under the Explore tab in Adobe Color. I decided to use it because it was the most trending one. For the desktop version of my website I used the darker colors on the pallete for my background and lighter ones for the text. For the tablet/mobile version, I flipped it and used lighter for background and darker for text. The codes for the colors used in this scheme are as follows: #042940, #005C53, #9FC131, #DBF227, #D6D58E. Below I have attached the link of the color set.
